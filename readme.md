# 💤 Sleep Disease Detection

A university project developed during the first year of the Artificial Intelligence program.  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to detect potential **sleep-related diseases** from physiological data.

---

## 📘 Overview

The notebook implements the full workflow for automatic sleep disease classification:
- **Data preprocessing** (cleaning, normalization, and missing value handling)  
- **Feature extraction** from biomedical signals  
- **Model training and evaluation** using supervised learning methods  
- **Performance metrics** including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

The goal is to analyze sleep patterns and identify anomalies that may indicate disorders such as insomnia, apnea, or hypersomnia.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Results

The trained models achieved solid accuracy in distinguishing normal sleep from potentially disordered patterns.
Detailed results, including confusion matrices and ROC curves, are available in the notebook.
